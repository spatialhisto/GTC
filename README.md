The algorithm derives compartments for neoplastic and
non-neplastic tissue based on selected in situ sequencing 
genes and compares the results to the tissue compartments 
classified by a pathologist specialist in colorectal cancer.
Afterwards, the algorithm counts the number of transcripts
in the compartments and calculates a vulcano plot.
